🤖 AI Helped Me Debug…
This project had its own comeback story:

GPT-4 helped debug async API failures with OpenAI calls
AI caught infinite re-render loops.
Ai helped me write sql file also.
It even helped write the roast tone prompts also generate readme file.
Thanks to ChatGPT, I fixed bugs faster than I fell off my own goals.
